# MAQS

## Introduction

MAQS stands for Modular automation quick start.

It …

-	is a modular test automation framework 
-	can be used as the base for your automation project or individual pieces can be used to enhance existing frameworks 
-	is maintained/extended by OpenMAQS volunteers

The main idea behind MAQS is to avoid **reinventing the wheel**. Most automation projects require the same basic set of features, and these features take a significant amount of time and effort to effectively implement.  MAQS streamlines automation efforts by providing a framework with these base features built in. This allows engineers to spend their time testing, rather than building and maintaining a one-off testing framework.
